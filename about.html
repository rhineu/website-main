                    <br> Founder</h1>
                <p>Hi everyone! My Reshika Sai Devarajan and I am a second year Health Science major at Northeastern University. As a native of the state of Maine, I have been deeply aware of the health disparities between the rural and urban populations of the state. After going on a rural immersion trip through Northeastern, I was able to learn more about the unique struggles rural residents face, especially older adults. One specific issue is that there is a lack of focus and resources on social isolation and loneliness in this population, which is why the idea of a Tele-Friend program came to mind, to help give older adults meaningful connections and form long-lasting companionships. After contacting my good friend Khoshna, we were able to create RHI and the Tele-Friend program to try to make a difference and better this dilemma. Some fun facts about me is that I was born in Canada and I love to read!</p></div>

                    <br> Co-Founder</h1>
                <p>Hi! My name is Khoshna and I’m currently a second year behavioral neuroscience student. I helped create this organization because currently, there are not many groups that address the health and social issues of rural residents. I found that social isolation was an especially relevant issue to focus on as we slowly transition to our post-quarantine world, which is why when Reshika originally reached out about starting something that advocated for rural health, I was eager to jump on board. Some fun facts about me are that I have a dog and a guinea pig (I love animals!), I met Roger Federer once at the US Open, and I can play the piano :)</p></div>
